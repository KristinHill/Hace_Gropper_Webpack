<!-- the way that these game frameworks thinks is that they are all based on a game/ render loop. in phaser, the function is UPDATE() Kris says : i imagine it like react hooks! here is a function im supplying that should run at a certain time. how often does update get called and when? YES! Lauren knows accidentally! It updates all the time forever! -->
<!-- the update function or game loop gets executed as much!! as possible!! updateupdateupdateupdate is a key being held down while is being called? thats movement bby 
read about the game loop and understand what update is ding, update recieves a parameter that tells u how long the update was after the last update, its called delta time! -->
